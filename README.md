# recognitio

Recognitio is a study tool that automatically generates quizbowl-formatted questions with a single-player buzzing system.

## Usage

To start, recognitio requires a ontology containing the information from which it can generate questions. The ontology can be loaded from your filesystem in the 'prefs' section. Ontologies are `.ontl` files, written in [ontologica](https://github.com/recognitio/ontologica).

## Motivation

As of this writing, mid-November 2018, recognitio has been a three-month long project that has really been in conception for over a year. I'm a senior in high school now, and I've participated in quizbowl since the latter half of freshman year. That's nearly three years of quiz - and in that time, it's grown on me far more than I ever thought it would when I first joined. I wanted to give back to the quizbowl community - and not just locally, but to the international community as a whole - and combined with my passion for programming, the opportunity to work on this project was a dream. So, here it is. This is what I'm giving back to a community that has given so much to me.

## Contributing

While I still have time, I plan to continue developing this through the end of 2018 and the first half of 2019, and resume maintaining it from 2021 onwards. Currently, contributions will not be accepted because there have been no guidelines set in place as of yet.
